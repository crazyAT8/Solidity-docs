Chapter 14: Web3.js

    Our Solidity contract is complete! 
    Now we need to write a JavaScript frontend 
        that interacts with the contract.

    Ethereum has a JavaScript library called Web3.js.

    In a later lesson, 
        we'll go over in depth how to deploy a contract 
            and set up Web3.js. 
    But for now let's just look at some sample code 
        for how Web3.js would interact with our deployed contract.

    Don't worry if this doesn't all make sense yet.

                        SEE script.js 


    What our JavaScript then does is take the values generated in zombieDetails above, 
        and use some browser-based JavaScript magic (we're using Vue.js) 
            to swap out the images and apply CSS filters. 
            You'll get all the code for this in a later lesson.

Give it a try!

    Go ahead â€” type in your name to the box on the right, and see what kind of zombie you get!

    Once you have a zombie you're happy with, 
        go ahead and click "Next Chapter" below to save your zombie and complete lesson 1!
